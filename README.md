# OOPAssignment
This is my assignment for my Object Oriented Programming module.

The assignment was to take a scrambled image and compare it to a noisy but unscrambled image using a Nearest Neighbour Search algorithm, and unscramble the image to return a correct version.

The code is written in C++ and is fully functional for the required task.
